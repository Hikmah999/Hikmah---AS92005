This will mean that we dont need to worry too much about bamboo when it comes to sustainability. This is also an eco-friendly material that does not harm the local ecosystem and wildlife. Therefore bamboo is a really sustainable and ecofriendly material used to make ecofriendly homes in the future.</h1>
