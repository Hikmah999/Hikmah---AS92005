                <h1>Bamboo</h1>
                <p>Bamboo is a natural renewable material which makes bamboo a sustainable choice. Cutting down bamboo canes assumes the growth of new bamboo canes, which means that if you keep cutting and harvesting down bamboo canes then it will encourage faster growth. This will mean that we dont need to worry too much about bamboo when it comes to sustainability. This is also an eco-friendly material that does not harm the local ecosystem and wildlife. Therefore bamboo is a really sustainable and eco friendly material used to make ecofriendly homes in the future.</p>
